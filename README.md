# Smart Traffic Management using RL, SUMO, OpenCV & IoT

An intelligent traffic control solution for **SIH 2025 Problem Statement 50**, focused on mitigating urban traffic congestion through **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **SUMO simulation**, **OpenCV-based computer vision**, and **IoT integration**.

---

## üìñ Problem Statement

Traffic congestion arises due to unbalanced signal timing, fluctuating traffic density, and the limited adaptability of traditional controllers. Our solution leverages **adaptive, data-driven methods** that integrate **computer vision** and **IoT** to make real-time, intelligent traffic management decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

* **Data Collection**: Roadside IoT sensors (cameras, inductive loops, GPS-enabled vehicles) capture real-time traffic data.
* **Computer Vision**: OpenCV processes video feeds to detect and track vehicles, estimate queue lengths, and classify vehicle types.
* **IoT Data Fusion**: Streams such as air quality, weather, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) signals are integrated to form a rich state vector.
* **RL Controller**: Trained in **SUMO** via TraCI, the RL agent dynamically optimizes green splits, phase durations, and offsets.
* **Reward Function**: Minimizes waiting time, reduces emissions, and maximizes throughput. Domain randomization ensures resilience across varying conditions.
