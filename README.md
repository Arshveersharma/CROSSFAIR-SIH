# Urban Traffic Congestion Mitigation Project

## Overview
We are from **UIET, Punjab University, Chandigarh**,Observing the city of Chandigarh itself led us to understand the problem of urban traffic congestion.  

Originally, Chandigarh was designed for **500,000 residents**, but today it houses **1.26 million people**. This rapid increase in population has created an urgent need to **upgrade the traffic system** to relieve bottlenecks and improve emergency response, potentially saving lives by enabling quicker access to hospitals and same has been the fate of many cities, cities like **Bhubaneswar, Odisha**, where traffic congestion is a growing concern.  

Bhubaneswar, originally designed for a smaller population, now faces **rapid urban growth**, putting immense pressure on its traffic system. This situation calls for **upgrading the traffic management infrastructure** 

## Our Model
Our model is designed to **intelligently manage and optimize traffic flow** in urban areas using modern technologies. It integrates:  

- **Real-time traffic data collection** using IoT sensors and cameras.  
- **Adaptive traffic signal control** to minimize congestion and waiting times.  
- **Simulation-based analysis** using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) for planning and testing.  
- **Emergency response prioritization** to ensure vehicles like ambulances get clear paths.  
- **Manual override option** for traffic authorities to intervene in real time during unusual or emergency situations.

## Interface for Authorities
The system includes a **dashboard for traffic management authorities** with the following features:  

- **Live traffic monitoring** with real-time visualization of congested areas.  
- **Control panel** to manually override automatic signals if required.  
- **Notifications and alerts** for incidents, accidents, or high congestion zones.  
- **Simulation feedback** to predict the effects of manual interventions on traffic flow.  

This interface ensures that authorities have **full control over traffic management**, combining automation with human decision-making for maximum efficiency.

## Key Features
- Adaptive, data-driven traffic control  
- Real-time monitoring of vehicle density  
- Emergency vehicle prioritization  
- Manual override for traffic authorities  
- Simulation and predictive analysis for urban planning  

## Future Work
- Integration with AI-based predictive traffic management  
- Expansion to multi-city networks for large-scale urban planning  
- Mobile application for live traffic updates to citizens
